<h1>Installing Eclipse</h1>

We'll be using Eclipse for writing our Java code in this hackathon. 
Eclipse is a free development environment which is available for all common operating systems.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

JRE/JDK 1.7

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>

Eclipse does not require an installer, you just need to copy the 32/64 bit version for your OS (which one you need depends on your installed Java version) to the desired path and extract it.

<h2>After the installation</h2>

<h3>Configure the default JDK</h3>

Open the Preferences menu via: Window => Preferences
Navigate to Java => Installed JREs and add your installed JDK and configure it as the default JDK.

<h3>Maven configuration</h3>

Navigate in the preferences menu to Maven => Installations and add your locally installed Maven version, and configure it as the default rather than the embedded one.
